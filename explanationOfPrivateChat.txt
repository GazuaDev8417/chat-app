/* 
It sounds like you've created a chat app using Socket.io, 
but you're looking to enable private, one-on-one conversations between users in
addition to the existing chat rooms. To achieve this, you can implement private 
messaging by following these steps:

User Authentication: Make sure you have user authentication in place,
so you know who is using your app and can track which users are online.

User List: Maintain a list of online users with unique identifiers 
(e.g., user IDs or usernames).

Socket.io Namespace: Create a separate Socket.io namespace for private messages.
Namespaces allow you to create separate communication channels within the same server.
This will keep private conversations isolated from chat rooms.

const privateNamespace = io.of('/private');


Handling Private Messages: When a user wants to start a private conversation,
they can select another user from the list and send a private message request.
Here's a basic example of how to handle it:
*/

// In the main namespace
const privateNamespace = io.of('/private')
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    // ...
  
    socket.on('privateMessageRequest', (recipientUserId, message) => {
      // Find the recipient socket by user ID
      const recipientSocket = ''// Code to find the recipient socket;
  
      if (recipientSocket) {
        // Emit the private message to the recipient
        recipientSocket.emit('privateMessage', {
          sender: socket.userId, // Sender's ID
          message: message,
        });
      }
    });
  });
  
  // In the private namespace
  privateNamespace.on('connection', (socket) => {
    socket.on('privateMessage', (data) => {
      // Handle the private message here and send it to the recipient
    });
  });


/*
Client-Side Handling: On the client side, you need to handle private message requests
and messages. When a user selects a recipient for a private conversation, you should
emit a 'privateMessageRequest' event, and when a private message is received, 
you can display it in the user's private chat window.
Remember to add proper error handling, user presence tracking, and other security
measures to protect the privacy of users.
With these steps, you can enable private one-on-one conversations alongside your 
chat rooms. Users can request private conversations, and messages sent in private 
conversations are handled separately from messages in chat rooms. 

To find the recipientSocket for a private message, you need to maintain a data 
structure that maps user identifiers (e.g., user IDs or usernames) to their 
corresponding Socket.io socket objects. You can use an object or a Map to store this
information. Here's an example using an object to store these mappings:
*/

const connectedUsers = {}; // Object to store connected users and their sockets

// In the main namespace
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Handle user authentication and store user information, e.g., user ID or username
  const userId = getUserIdSomehow(); // Replace this with your authentication logic

  // Store the user's socket
  connectedUsers[userId] = socket;

  socket.on('privateMessageRequest', (recipientUserId, message) => {
    const recipientSocket = connectedUsers[recipientUserId];

    if (recipientSocket) {
      // Emit the private message to the recipient
      recipientSocket.emit('privateMessage', {
        sender: userId, // Sender's ID
        message: message,
      });
    }
  });

  // ...
});

// In the private namespace
privateNamespace.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('privateMessage', (data) => {
    // Handle the private message here and send it to the recipient
  });
});

/* 
In this example, the connectedUsers object stores user IDs as keys and their
corresponding Socket.io sockets as values. When a private message is requested,
you look up the recipient's userId in this object to find their recipientSocket.
If a match is found, you can emit the private message to the recipient.
Make sure to implement proper user authentication and error handling to ensure
that unauthorized users cannot access private conversations. Additionally, consider
handling user disconnections and removing disconnected users from the connectedUsers
object to keep it up to date.
